### Mission of Mastery Division
Mastery Division is an open source education company, dedicated to creating as many open source developers as possible. We believe that only through open source education can the open source movement truly thrive.

Mastery - comprehensive knowledge or skill in a subject or accomplishment.

Division - the action of separating something into parts, or the process of being separated.
